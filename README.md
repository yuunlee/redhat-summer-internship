# redhat-summer-internship
Documentation for 2022 summer internship with Red Hat

## Project Goal
The summer project is a side project for [Sandiego](https://github.com/sandiego-rh/sandiego) and [Explorer](https://github.com/sandiego-rh/explorer). Project Sandiego is a front-end development the gleans information from open source ecosystem data sets that help drive community and business-oriented decision making. The goal for my summer project is to develop formulas for the accumulated activity/ community/ performance metrics based on Github activities for organizations and repos in an open source community, which helps community managers monitor and diagnose the community health.
The project took metrics in [CHAOSS](https://chaoss.community/) and [ORBIT MODEL](https://orbitmodel.com/) as references.
